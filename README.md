This project has only been tested on Windows. Other platforms might work. Do ask for help on the [mailing list](https://sourceforge.net/projects/texttest/lists/texttest-users) if you want to try this.

You will need to have installed and set up several tools and services locally:

* [Python](http://python.org)
* [DotNet SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/sdk-for-vs-code)
* [MongoDB server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
